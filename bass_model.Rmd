It is performed a look-alike analysis with the bass diffusion model to understand the expected behavior of new product, in this case a smart watch, and particularly, Apple ultra watch 2 in the market. The aim of diffusion bass model is to take a similar product, for which there is available data and try to make predictions for the new product. In this particular example, the proportion of apple smart watches in the past, and the total number of smart watch users worldwide are taken to analyze and evaluate the role of the new apple smart watch in the market. Read further details and the sources in the readme file.


```{r}
data<- read.csv("apple_watch.csv")
total_users = 219430000
data<-data.frame(data)
data$users = data$proportion * total_users
head(data)
```


```{r}
diffusion_estimate <- diffusion(data$users)
p_estimate <- as.numeric(diffusion_estimate$w[1])
q_estimate <- as.numeric(diffusion_estimate$w[2])
m_estimate <- as.numeric(diffusion_estimate$w[3])
diffusion_estimate
```
Here we can see that innovator's rate is about 0.005, imitator's rate is about 0.15, and market share is about 260 billion.


```{r}
bass.f <- function(t,p,q){
  ((p+q)^2/p)*exp(-(p+q)*t)/
    (1+(q/p)*exp(-(p+q)*t))^2}
```



```{r}
bass.F <- function(t,p,q){
  (1-exp(-(p+q)*t))/
    (1+(q/p)*exp(-(p+q)*t)) }
```



```{r}
cum_ad<-ggplot(data.frame(t = c(1, 32)), aes(t)) +
stat_function(fun = bass.F, args = c(p=p_estimate, q=q_estimate)) + 
  labs(title = 'Cumalative adaptions for Apple watches', y='cumulative adoptions')
cum_ad
```
Here we can see the distrbution of the 

```{r}
time_ad<-ggplot(data.frame(t = c(1, 32)), aes(t)) +
stat_function(fun = bass.f, args = c(p=p_estimate, q=q_estimate)) + 
  labs(title = 'The Apple watch adoptions at time t', y='proportion of adoptions')
time_ad

```
Here we can notice the proportion of adoptions change over time.


Calculating the number of adopters.

```{r}
data$number_of_adopters = bass.f(1:32, p = p_estimate, q = q_estimate)* 219430000
data
```

```{r}
innovation_diffusion_estimate<-diffusion(data$number_of_adopters)
p_estimate_innovation <- as.numeric(innovation_diffusion_estimate$w[1])
q_estimate_innovation <- as.numeric(innovation_diffusion_estimate$w[2])
m_estimate_innovation <- as.numeric(innovation_diffusion_estimate$w[3])
innovation_diffusion_estimate
```

Now, as we can see the numbers are about 0.0046 rate of innovators, about 0.1 of imitator's rate, and 270188 market size for the new product at this point of time.


```{r}
time_ad<-ggplot(data.frame(t = c(1, 32)), aes(t)) +
stat_function(fun = bass.f, args = c(p=0.0046, q=0.1)) + 
  labs(title = 'Number of addopters at time t')
time_ad
```


```{r}
cum_ad<-ggplot(data.frame(t = c(1, 32)), aes(t)) +
stat_function(fun = bass.F, args = c(p=0.0046, q=0.1)) + 
  labs(title = 'Number of addopters by the time t')
cum_ad
```

Here we can see how the results are changed for the new product, which is logical to have less proportion of the market at the beginning.
